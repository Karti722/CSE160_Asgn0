I used ChatGPT for the Vector3 Cross function and StackOverflow for the event.preventDefault() to prevent the site from reloading after drawing a vector. The rest of the code was written by me otherwise.

# One more Note:
I changed the asg0.html file name to index.html since GitHub pages only renders the page if the main html file is called index.html. Hopefully I don't get deducted for this.
